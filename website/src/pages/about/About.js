            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>From a young age, I've always been interested in computers/computer programming. I've provided a short chronicle of my life and career in CS/Engineering below.</p>
        </div>
        <div className="banner">
            <h1>~5 years ago</h1>
            <p>About 5 years ago, I first got into coding through web development. At the time, I was learning HTMl, CSS, a little JavaScript, web hosting, and version control.</p>
            <p>The peak of this experience was a website dedicated towards gaming, made using the Silex web editor, HTML/CSS, Flash games, and GitHub pages.</p>
            <p>I was also interested at the time in hosting with Heroku, SMS messaging with Twilio, and authentication with Firebase.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, COVID-19 interrupted this period of time so during the pandemic I had not completed much.</p>

            <h1>~3 years ago</h1>
            <p>Around this time is when I really got into programming again. I took advanced FLVS courses and learned Python, TkinterUI, Matplotlib, and I was becoming familiar with Numpy.</p>
            <p>I aimed to complete a variety of projects, many of which did not come into fruition.</p>
            <p>Most notably, I submitted a graphing calculator in Python for my AP Computer Science Principles final project and tried to start a social chat app.</p>
        </div>
        <div className="banner">
            <h1>~1 year ago - today</h1>
            <p>About 1 year ago, I transferred into FAU High School, allowing me to take advanced programming coursework and participate in a broader range of extracurriculars.</p>
            <p>This allowed me to take the university courses on C and C++. Additionally, as I was a member of the FAU HS coding club, I was inspired to learn JavaScript and go back to web development.</p>
            <p>Using these skills, I've worked on AEV Software, Arc, WebWrite, and many more projects. (more on the projects page) </p>
            <p>Additionally, as a result of a science fair project, I became interested in AI, computer vision, and data analytics.</p>
            <p>This led me to working towards conducting undergraduate research supervised by Mahmoud Seifallahi, a graduate student in the Biomedical Signal/Image Analysis Lab run by Dr. Behnaz Ghoraani.</p>
            <p>Today, I hope to continue my research, publish, further refine my skills in computer science and engineering, and use technology to make the world better like I was trying to do 5 years ago with my gaming website.</p>
